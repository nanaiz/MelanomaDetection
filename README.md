## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The current analysis is based on the "Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration" dataset

## Conclusions
We managed to eliminate overfitting and managed to reach a decent accuracy by using:
- Data augmentation
- Managing Class imbalance
- Using Dropout Layers
